# First Assembly Windows

Create a tiny **Windows** graphical application using pure **Assembly**. (MASM)

> If you are new to Assembly in Windows, you need to install **MASM32** first. I already uploaded the setup file to the repository. so you can easily download and install its setup. I downloaded it from the internet. For security reasons, you can download it from official sources to make sure.
